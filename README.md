# Open Scale-up

An open source bioreactor for the small scale production of biological compounds.

## Why?

The ability to harness the capabilities of living organisms shouldn't be limited to well funded labs and large commercial enterprises. Fermentation has been a key part of our shared cultural heritage for millennia and should remain so.

## Project Ethos

### Open Scale-up is not a toy

Over the years there have been many papers and thesis projects written on the design and construction of low-cost benchtop bioreactors. While built in earnest many of these projects have been strictly demonstration units and their designs have not been amenable to being scaled-up for production.

Open Scale-up is designed right from the start with scale-up in mind. This is an exercise in building a production grade system from off the shelf components and achieving savings through economy of scale.
